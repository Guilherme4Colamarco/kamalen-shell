> 🎨 **A dynamic and responsive setup for MangoWM that changes colors like a chameleon, adapting to any wallpaper instantly.**

## 📢 The Concept

Most Linux rices/setups are custom-built to work with only one specific wallpaper and a static color palette. **Kamalen Shell** breaks this barrier: it is designed to extract colors from whatever image you set as a wallpaper and propagate this palette dynamically across your entire system.

No matter what image you throw at it, 90% of the time it will generate a cohesive and pleasing theme without you having to open a single configuration file. It also features 5 different animation profiles (bubbly, calm, snappy, extraslow, none) to adapt to your workflow.

## 🚀 What's actually cool?

* **Smart Color Extraction** — A Python script (`iris.py`) uses K-Means clustering in LAB color space to identify the dominant tones of the active wallpaper. It generates background, foreground, accent, and even code syntax highlighting colors, applying them instantly to:
  - **Kitty** (via socket in real time, no restart needed)
  - **Neovim** (creates a dynamic Lua color scheme)
  - **GTK 3/4** (writes CSS directly to theme folders)
  - **MangoWM** (updates window border colors)
  - **Starship Prompt** (syncs your terminal prompt)

* **3D Wallpaper Picker** — No more boring grids. Navigate your wallpapers in a cylindrical 3D carousel that plays GIFs and videos in the center card. Press `R` to pick a random one!

* **Integrated Lockscreen** — Built in Quickshell, it supports video/GIF wallpapers with a dynamic blur effect, uses Python PAM for super-fast authentication, and displays animations for incorrect password attempts.

* **Fully Modular** — Change animation speeds, toggle transparency, adjust window border radius, or change the bar style with simple clicks on the panel.

## 📥 Installation

The installation script was developed and tested on **Arch Linux** (and derivatives like CachyOS).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Guilherme4Colamarco/kamalen-shell.git
cd kamalen-shell
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### What the installer does:
- Installs all system dependencies and compiles `mango-ext` automatically.
- Safely backs up your old configurations to `~/.dotfiles-backup-<timestamp>`.
- Copies everything to `~/.config/`.
- Configures the PAM authentication service for the lockscreen.
- Creates the required cache and state directories.

**Next steps after installing:**
1. Log out of your current session.
2. Select **MangoWM** (or mango-ext) from your login manager.
3. Log back in.
4. Run `~/.config/scripts/random-wallpaper.sh` to set your first color theme!

## ✨ Features in Detail

### 🎨 Color Extraction (Iris Engine)
The `iris.py` script handles all the heavy lifting. It downscales the image to optimize processing speed, analyzes the spatial distribution of colors, and generates ideal palettes (including auto dark/light modes). Everything is cached, making returning to a previous wallpaper instantaneous.

### 🎞️ Animation Profiles
You can change the system personality on the control panel by choosing from 5 profiles:
- **bubbly**: Bouncy, springy, overshooting transitions (default).
- **calm**: Slow, smooth, macOS-style transitions.
- **snappy**: Fast, clean, and highly responsive.
- **extraslow**: Graceful and slow-paced movements.
- **none**: Instant transitions (no animations).

### 🔒 Lockscreen
Displays clock, date, and profile picture. Plays the same video or GIF background as your desktop with a continuous blur effect. Features password length dots and a shake animation for failed authentication attempts.
*(Security Note: `killall quickshell` bypasses the lockscreen. It is a visual convenience lock, not a high-security vault).*

### 🖼️ 3D Wallpaper Picker
Activated with `Super + W`. Use `H/L` or arrow keys to rotate the wallpaper cylinder. Hovering over a video or GIF starts playback on the card. Press `Enter` to apply, and the system colors will update in under 2 seconds.

### 🎵 Media Control
A top-center drop-down widget that shows playback status via `playerctl` (Spotify, Firefox, mpv, etc.). Supports interactive progress bars, scrolling marquee titles, and two visualization modes: **Vinyl mode** (spinning vinyl record with album art overlay) and **GIF mode** (dynamic GIFs synced to the music). A 12-bar Cava visualizer is rendered at the base.

### 📊 Dashboard
A right-side panel housing your profile picture, system uptime, power menu, and 11 quick setting tiles (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, DND, Transparency, Power profiles, Animation profiles, and border radius). It also groups notifications by app.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- **System Tray:** Some applications require starting the bar under a full Qt application session for right-click context menus to render. If the tray disappears or hangs, restart the bar with `quickshell & disown`.
- **Extreme Color Extraction:** Wallpapers that are completely black, white, or have excessively complex gradients might occasionally yield low-contrast accent colors. Photographic or graphic illustrations are recommended.
- **Initial Wallpaper Loading:** The first run of the carousel might experience a slight delay while thumbnails are generated in the background.
